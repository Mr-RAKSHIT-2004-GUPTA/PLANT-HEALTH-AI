# 🌱 Plant Diary NFT

**Plant Diary NFT** is a mobile-first AI tool that helps farmers understand plant health using a simple photo of a leaf. The app detects diseases using a lightweight pretrained MobileNet model, generates an easy-to-understand diary-style message written as if the plant is speaking, and stores each entry permanently on the Ethereum blockchain as an NFT.
